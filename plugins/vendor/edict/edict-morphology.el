;;; Changelog:

;; 1998-03-27  Stephen Turnbull  <turnbull@sk.tsukuba.ac.jp>
;;        (created):  broken out from monolithic edict.el

;;; Code:

(require 'cl)				; for defstruct

;;; Constants:

;; The edict-category-* variables are used to emulate the character
;; categories for regexps that are (partially) documented, but not
;; implemented, in XEmacs/Mule (20.5).  It should be possible to use
;; ranges for this, in the sense that defined legal characters in a
;; given range are guaranteed to be of the appropriate category.  The
;; reason is that each Mule-defined character set will occupy such a
;; range by virtue of the leading-byte implementation (see `Info |
;; Internals | MULE Character Sets and Encodings | Internal Mule
;; Encodings | Internal Character Encoding' for the easily understood
;; character type representation; the Bufbyte representation is a
;; simple transformation format of varying width).  Then JIS, at
;; least, carefully arranges the categories of characters into
;; non-overlapping ranges (ranges > 96 code points (94 for JIS) are
;; necessarily non-contiguous, see the info section cited above---this
;; is why undefined or illegal characters cannot be ruled out).  Mule
;; itself is happy to insert undefined characters---try eval'ing
;; (insert (int-char (+ (char-int ?瑤) 3)))---but balks at illegal
;; ones---(insert (int-char (- (char-int ?亜) 1))).  However, there
;; are two holes in JIS X 0208 (between the yomi-ordered Level 1 kanji
;; and the radical-ordered Level 2, and at the end of the character
;; set) and these undefined characters can be inserted, eg by the LISP
;; code above.

;; Regexp ranges cannot be depended on; they work for all JIS-derived
;; encodings (including EUC, ISO-2022-JP, and SJIS), but won't for
;; UCS/Unicode.  Watch out for (eg) Big-5 in trying to generalize this
;; code.

;; The values for the ranges are taken from Ken Lunde, Understanding
;; Japanese Information Processing, (C) 1993 O'Reilly & Associates,
;; Sebastopol, CA, and from 錦見・高橋・戸村・半田・桑理・向川・吉田、
;; マルチリンガル環境の実現、プレンティスホール出版.

;; The syntax of the rules is:
;; (define-edict-rule name <pattern> <conversion-function> <conversion-data>).
;; 
;;  <pattern> is a regular expression, with the parts to be substituted
;;  being denoted by \\(<subpattern>\\).
;; 
;;  <conversion function> is a funtion responsible for determining
;;  the replacements.  The current choices are
;;  edict-subst-modified-affix and edict-subst-affix.  These
;;  functions are called just after doing match-string, so the regexp
;;  variables are set up.  They are applied to the string, and
;;  <conversion-data>.  These functions are responsible for
;;  determining and performing the substitutions to be made, and
;;  returning a list of possiblities.
;; 
;;  edict-subst-affix is the simpler case.  It takes as conversion
;;  data one string for each subpattern in the pattern.  This string
;;  will be used in place of the original.
;; 
;;  edict-subst-modified-affix takes as conversion data, an
;;  alternating list of functions and lists of additional arguments
;;  for those functions.  Each function is applied to the substring
;;  being replaced and its additional arguments.  Likely functions to
;;  use include edict-modify-verb, edict-ignore, and edict-subst.
