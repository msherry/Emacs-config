Summary of changes to oauth2.el
-------------------------------

(For changes of 0.16 and older please check the git history of the
repository of oauth2.el.)

* 0.17

** Changes to plstore id generation and needs to reacquire refresh_token

The generation of plstore id used to include `auth-url', `token-url',
and `scope'.  Now `client-id' is also included.  This is required to
support multiple accounts of some providers which use the same
`auth-url', `token-url', and `scope' (e.g. Gmail), or the generated
plstore id is not unique amount accounts.  Adding `client-id' solves
this problem.

The hash function of calculating the plstore id has also changed from
MD5 to SHA512 to be more secure.

As a result, users of oauth2.el will need to redo the authentication
process to get a new refresh_token when upgrading from older version
to 0.17.
