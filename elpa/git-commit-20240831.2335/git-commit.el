;;; Commentary:

;; This package has been merged into `magit' itself.
;;
;; The "git-commit.el" library is no longer distributed as a separate
;; package.  It is now distributed as part of the `magit' package.
;;
;; The `git-commit' package now does nothing but display a warning.
;; If it is located earlier on the `load-path' than `magit' is, then that
;; prevents the proper "git-commit.el" library from `magit' from being
;; loaded.
;;
;; Do not install the `git-commit' package and if it is still installed,
;; then please uninstalling it and restart Emacs.

The \"git-commit.el\" library is no longer distributed as a separate
package.  It is now distributed as part of the `magit' package.

The `git-commit' package now does nothing but display this warning.
If it is located earlier on the `load-path' than `magit' is, then that
prevents the proper \"git-commit.el\" libraries from `magit' from being
loaded.

Please uninstalling `git-commit' and then restart Emacs.
